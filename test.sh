# This script was created with the objective of simplifying the compilation of C programs from command line.
# Created to be used with GCC and Valgrind on Linux. If you plan to run this scripts for other compilers or 
# in other OS you will need to adjust the script.

# Directory with the files to compile. It will search for files with extension .c and .h on every dir inside 
# this directory. Caution, when pointed to the software's main folder it can compile the tests along with the
# program.

# This script imports the test dir and compile it along with the program. This is because
# the script was made mainly for running tests. You can modify it as you need to compile
# your main program, use other compiler flags etc.

# Compile the test

# Run the program
